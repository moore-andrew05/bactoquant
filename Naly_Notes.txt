Channels:

1 - Control, non-symmetric RNA.
2 - erm1
3 - MTs
4 - DAPI

Larger cell is anterior, place on left. 


*--*

Workflow:

IN FIJI:
Rotate embryo so that anterior cell is on left -> Save as tiff.

IN PYTHON:
Open Image, max project, and crop horizontal (and maybe vertical) background.
Save cropped tiff for visualization. 

Collapse vertical axis of embryo into 1d vector representing sum of values in each column. 
Interpolate vectors to common length, also need to make note of micron conversion.

VISUALIZATION:
Line graph with one representative image, then some representation of the average of the group.
Each should graph both Control and erm1 for ez comparison.
